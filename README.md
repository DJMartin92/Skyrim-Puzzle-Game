Skyrim Puzzle Game
An HTML/CSS/JavaScript dungeon crawler inspired classic Skyrim dungeons.

What It Is

This is a text-based progression game. You move through themed “rooms” (Forgotten Barrow, Dragonsreach, Dwarven Ruins, etc.), each with its own story event, puzzle, or enemy. Some rooms offer stealth options, puzzles (like rotating pillar locks), or flat-out combat.

Features

Room-by-room progression with zone-based theming

Choices that affect the story (fight, sneak, solve, loot)

Event text changes dynamically as you go

A touch of humor and Skyrim references throughout

Why I Built It

This started as a school project and turned into something I genuinely had fun with. I wanted to bring in my love for Skyrim and storytelling while practicing logic, conditionals, arrays, and functions in JavaScript.

What’s Next

Eventually I might refactor some of the logic, clean up the codebase, and maybe even add sound or a simple inventory system. For now, it’s a passion piece that showcases my love for games, creativity, and functional JS code.
